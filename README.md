# MSER_Breast_XRay_Detector

Today I come up with a way of recognizing the syptoms in the Breast XRay image.
For imnormal situations, syptoms are showed as the most highest density areas, which might could be detected by MSER method.

I use an open code online using MSER method to detect character, and put it directly into use with the XRay image. Modification will be made later on.

MSER codes for character detection from: http://www.mamicode.com/info-detail-992854.html
